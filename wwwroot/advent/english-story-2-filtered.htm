<p class=MsoNormal>Turning corners at every opportunity she tried desperately
to throw off her pursuers. <i>Why did it have to be today? </i>She thought,
angrily. <i>This was my best outfit. My only red one and I love red. Plus it’s
my only one that has any recognisable white. If they ruin it...Oh, they will
pay! </i>Seeing a possible escape route, she climbed up some bins onto a garage
roof and then onto its adjoining house. <i>It’s too hot! </i>She complained
trying to catch her breath. “Look! There she is!”. More police officers had
joined the first. <i>Off I go again.</i> Kate thought and took a running leap
across to the next building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some clever officer thought to block her off ad climber up
onto the next building preventing her from going any further. Slowly so as not
to cause alarm, she backed away. Her calves hit something hard signalling the
end of her retreat. It was a chimney. “Now, why don’t you come nicely and no
one will get hurt. There’s nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. So, what’ll it
be?” <i>Police officers. </i>Kate thought, exasperated. <i>They just can’t help
saying the clichés. No way am I going to get caught by these dummies. A light
suddenly switched on inside her head. </i>Smiling, she brought out her gun so
as to scare them enough so she could manoeuvre without being shot at. “I’m so
very sorry.” She said, carefully perching on the chimney. “But even though I do
appreciate your offer I’m a bit busy at the moment. Maybe another time?”. As
she finished her goodbye, she stood up and jumped down the chimney, landing,
covered in soot from head to toe, in the grate. Thankfully, it was open
fireplace and wasn’t lit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A girl, probably about 5 or 6, stood in the room her mouth
open in amazement. “Mummy! Mummy! Look! It’s…” Kate was already across the room
and didn’t catch the rest of the sentence. Outside the door, she saw a horse
and leaped on its back. It didn’t seem to like her but she held on tight and
managed to stop it bucking and make some progress. There was no saddle or bridle
but there was something else. It had antlers. <i>First, I get tired out running
from the police. Second, I get my best outfit dirty. And then now, I make my
escape on a reindeer. This just gets better and better. </i>She thought
cursing.<i> Well, at least I got what I came for. </i>Kate reached for her
pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The girl inspected the parcel, then picked it up and showed
her Mum. “Mummy, look. Look what Santa brought me.” The girl opened it and her
mum’s eyes widened, reflecting something glittery. “Where did you get that?”
She breathed.</p>
