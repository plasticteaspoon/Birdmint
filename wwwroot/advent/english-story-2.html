    <p class=MsoNormal>Turning corners at every opportunity she tried desperately to throw off her pursuers. <i>Why did it have to be today? </i>She thought,angrily. <i>This was my best outfit. My only red one and I love red. Plus it&#39;s my only one that has any recognisable white. If they ruin it... Oh, they will pay! </i>Seeing a possible escape route, she climbed up some bins onto a garage roof and then onto its adjoining house. <i>It&#39;s too hot! </i>She complained trying to catch her breath. &#39;Look! There she is!&#39;. More police officers had joined the first. <i>Off I go again.</i> Kate thought and took a running leap across to the next building.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Eventually some clever officer thought to block her off and climbed up onto the next building preventing her from going any further. Slowly, so as not to cause alarm, she backed away. Her calves hit something hard signalling the end of her retreat. It was a chimney. &quot;Now, why don&#39;t you come along nicely and no one will get hurt. There&#39;s nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. So, what&#39;ll it be?&quot; <i>Police officers. </i>Kate thought, exasperated. <i>They just can&#39;t help saying the clich&#39;s. No way am I going to get caught by these dummies. A light suddenly switched on inside her head. </i>Smiling, she brought out her gun so as to scare them enough so she could manoeuvre without being shot at. &quot;I&#39;m so very sorry.&quot; She said, carefully perching on the chimney. &quot;But even though I do appreciate your offer I&#39;m a bit busy at the moment. Maybe another time?&quot;. As she finished her goodbye, she stood up and jumped down the chimney, landing,covered in soot from head to toe, in the grate. Thankfully, it was an open fireplace and wasn&#39;t lit.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>A girl, probably about 5 or 6, stood in the room her mouth open in amazement. &quot;Mummy! Mummy! Look! It&#39;s...&quot; Kate was already across the roomand didn&#39;t catch the rest of the sentence. Outside the door, she saw a horse and leaped on its back. It didn&#39;t seem to like her but she held on tight and managed to stop it bucking and make some progress. There was no saddle or bridle but it had something else. It had antlers. <i>First, I get tired out running from the police. Second, I get my best outfit dirty. And then now, I make my triumphant escape on a reindeer. This just gets better and better. </i>She thought.<i> Well, at least I got what I came for. </i>Kate reached for her pocket.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>The girl inspected the parcel, then picked it up and showed her Mum. &quot;Mummy, look. Look what Santa brought me.&quot; The girl opened it and her mum&#39;s eyes widened, reflecting something glittery. &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;She breathed.</p>
